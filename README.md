# A quick project done in less than two days for the 2015 Tonys. I made predictions of who I thought would win, who I was rooting for and updated the winners throughout the night. Icons from the Noun Project and noted on the project page their specific creators. Information on nominees from tonyawards.com

I built this by creating a public spreadsheet on Google Docs and made an ajax request to that location's json view. Currently, the results are stored in a static JSON file.
